<H1>About Me</H1>

<p>Hi! My name is Skylar Crews, or "Sky" for short. I am working on developing my coding skills. Please enjoy this website and follow along as I grow as a coder. Below, I will list random filler information so I can see what this website will look like when I truly fill it out.</p>

<p>Some of my hobbies include playing pickleball, baking, and crafting. Of course, by "crafting" I mean that I enjoy starting a thousand projects but never finishing them. My craftiness and passion for being in the kitchen stem from all of the slumber parties I would have at my paternal grandmother's house every weekend as a child. She taught me all she knew about making sweet treats. My grandmother also encouraged me to let my creativity soar. She purchased me endless crafting supplies. I have many fond memories of the two of us sitting at the kitchen table coloring. We loved coloring together most of all. </p>

<p>I have two pets, a dog and a rabbit. My dog is a black labrador named "Jake." In true lab style, Jake enjoys swimming and eating. He also loves attention. Even though he is physically a large dog and some people think that he is scary-looking, Jake hates storms of any kind. Whenever a storm comes through he insists on being a lap dog. Our rabbit is an Eastern Cottontail I rehabbed. Her name is "Hunny." She enjoys berries, zoomies, watching thunderstorms, and bulling the dog that weighs fourty times her own weight.</p>
